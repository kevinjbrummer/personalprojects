Tokyo Organizing Committee Chairman Mori was attending the meeting. During the meeting's conclusion, he had remarked, "A board of directors with many women takes its time," regarding the goal to increase the number of female directors.

He used his own experience as chairman and honorary chairman of the Japan Rugby Football Union, where the number of women directors is rising. "It takes twice as much time as before. Women have a fierce competitive spirit. Whenever someone raises their hand to speak, they think that they have to say something too. And then everyone talks, " were among his statements.

Director Kaori Yamaguchi "Extremely Disappointing"
Concerning Chairman Mori's remark, JOC (Japanese Olympic Committee) member Director Kaori Yamaguchi agreed to an interview. "It is extremely disappointing that while the importance of diversity is at the core of the Tokyo Games, thoughts like those held by top members are shared around the world," she said.

Director Yamaguchi, who has been making efforts to appoint women in the sports world, had joined the JOC conference on the 3rd as an observer. "At first, when I had heard his remark, I couldn't understand what the intention was," she thought back. "If women at a meeting cause increased discussion, then he should be delighted." She stated about Chairman Mori's remark, "A board of directors with women takes its time."

What's more, concerning the effect of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, she said, "While I feel that many are siding with delaying or postponing, I believe it is important to send a message to the world and give the people a sense of security by having open discussions. This remark negates the discussion itself, and I think the Games' image may be brought down. There is no choice but to hold open discussions involving athletes and the public, restoring trust in us, and exploring whether we can gather a 'Let's Go!' momentum."
Japan Rugby Football Union "Lively discussions, regardless of gender"
Regarding Chairman Mori's remark, the Japan Rugby Football Union said, "We will refrain from commenting due to our lack of understating regarding the context of his statement. However, we will say that with our board, we have lively discussions regardless of gender. "

During Director Mori's remarks, he had used the increasing number of female directors in the Japan Rugby Football Union's board as an example. He stated, "Things take twice as much time as before," regarding the committee.

According to the Union, within the 19 board members, there are currently five female directors, and "We are not aware of such comments," regarding this statement made by Chairman Mori.
AJJF's Noriko Mizoguchi, "Mr. Mori eliminating gender bias"
Noriko Mizoguchi, the winner of the Barcelona Olympics Women's Judo 52kg class silver medal and All Japan Judo Federation's current councilor, posted on the internet regarding Chairman Mori's remark.

"I think this isn't a problem of female directors, 'taking up so much time that it's difficult to end without regulating their time.' It has more to do with the ability of the meeting facilitator," she added.

She used her own judo federation as an example, "The former AJFF, which had been comprised of the federation's top yes men, was operated based solely on the obstructive inner circle's rules. The federation customs and relationships were prioritized over legal compliance as well as fraud being discovered with regards to things such as player selection and public funds," she presented.

"Currently, as a preventative measure against a recurrence, the sports organization governance code has been put into practical use in the sport's world. Above all, it is demanded to revitalize meetings by establishing a 'board of directors with a 40% or higher target ratio.' " 

She closed with, "I would like Mr. Mori to demonstrate his ability, as the top member of the Olympic Organizing Committee, to communicate to eliminate gender bias, realize Olympism, and become a model for sports governance."
